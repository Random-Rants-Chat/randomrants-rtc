# Random Rants - WebRTC signaling Server

WebRTC signaling server for random rants.
Used to easily stream videos through WebRTC.

**Current Random Rants functionallity using this server:**

- Cameras

- Microphones

- Screensharing

# Using the server

Go to static/screenshare.js, from there replace the hostnames with your server host names.
This should verify that you are using your servers.

Also you can [remix the project on glitch.com](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/randomrants-rtc) for a server that never requires hosting on your own computer.

# Testing

Go to the root http/https URL and press the button. Then wait for it to start the host. Now you can share your url with anyone (as long as the site is properly hosted).
